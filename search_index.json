["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction AFBI provides an animal disease surveillance and diagnostic service for the Northern Irish farming industry. Passive (scanning) surveillance is carried out by collecting and analysing data from post mortem and clinical samples submitted to the Omagh and Stormont laboratory sites of the Disease Surveillance and Investigation Branch (DSIB) of AFBI. Analysis of this data assists in establishing baselines for incidence of endemic disease, facilitating the recognition of new and emerging diseases and allowing the rapid identification of changing trends in disease prevalence. This will allow evidence based decision making regarding control by veterinary providers and at a national level. "],

Failure of passive transfer of maternal immunity was detected in 65% of blood samples tested using the ZST (zinc sulphate turbity test) from calves aged less than 10 days, highlighting the importance of good colostrum management. This year respiratory infections were the second most commonly diagnosed cause of death for this age group.

There were multiple aetiologies for respiratory infections identified. As in 2016 Mycoplasma bovis was the pathogen identified with the greatest frequency from cattle diagnosed with respiratory disease in 2017. At AFBI Mycoplasma bovis is detected by a PCR testing and positive results need to be interpreted in conjunction with gross and histopathological findings. Environmental factors also play a role in the condition. Parasitic bronchitis due to the lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus (Figure 3.3) was seen in 6.9% of bovine respiratory disease diagnoses cases with the expected seasonal peak in August. The economic cost of wastage and reduced productivity due to respiratory infections in the cattle industry is considerable. 3.1 Diagnoses by Group Table 3.1: The most common diagnostic groups on post-mortem examinations of bovine respiratory disease by AFBI during 2017 (n= 391 ) Category No. of cases Percentage Bacterial 220 56.3 Other 135 34.5 Viral 36 9.2 3.1.1 Bovine Respiratory Disease Diagnoses Table 3.2: Relative frequency of diagnoses in bovine respiratory disease recorded by AFBI during 2017, (n= 388 ) Category No. of cases Percentage Pneumonia - Mycoplasma bovis 90 23.2 Pneumonia - Other 87 22.4 Pneumonia - P. multocida 45 11.6 Pneumonia - A. pyogenes 35 9.0 Pneumonia - M. haemolytica 33 8.5 Pneumonia - Parasitic - husk 27 7.0 Respiratory - Other 22 5.7 Pneumonia - RSV 15 3.9 Pneumonia - IBR 12 3.1 Pneumonia - H. somnus 10 2.6 Pneumonia - BVD 5 1.3 Pneumonia - aspiration 4 1.0 Pneumonia - PI3 2 0.5 Pulmonary haemorrhage 1 0.3 Figure 3.1: Relative frequency of diagnoses in bovine respiratory disease recorded by AFBI during 2017, (n= 0 ) 3.1.2 Lungworm Figure 3.2: Cases of death due to lungworm in cattle recorded by AFBI during 2017, (n= 27 ) Figure 3.3: Trachea containing large numbers of lungworm (Dictyocaulus viviparus).

["bovine-abortions.html", "Chapter 4 Bovine Abortions 4.1 Salmonella Dublin Abortion", " Chapter 4 Bovine Abortions Bovine abortion is a significant cause of livestock wastage and results in considerable costs to the cattle industry. As a general guideline once the level of abortions exceeds 3% or if there are several abortions clustered together investigation should be carried out. Specimens from 427 bovine abortions and stillbirths were examined during 2017 (430 were examined in 2016). Significant pathogens were detected in 198 of these (46%). This diagnostic rate is comparable to other years and reflects the multiple aetiologies of bovine abortion and the fact that not all abortions are due to an infectious cause. Trueperella pyogenes and Bacillus licheniformis were the most commonly diagnosed pathogens as in previous years. Neospora caninum was the third most commonly diagnosed pathogen followed by Salmonella Dublin BVDV and E.coli. T. pyogenes is considered a sporadic cause of abortion through haematogenous spread and placentitis. Bacillus licheniformis also results in placentitis. B. licheniformis is ubiquitous, although silage, run-off water, foodstuffs and bedding that have become contaminated with silage effluent and wet spoiled hay are the most likely sources of infection.

["bovine-mastitis.html", "Chapter 6 Bovine Mastitis", " Chapter 6 Bovine Mastitis A total of 1147 bacterial isolates were cultured from milk samples submitted from acute and chronic mastitis cases. Significance of the organism depends on the cell count, the level of the organism isolated and whether or not the organism was isolated in pure culture. Isolation of 3 or more species suggests contamination during sampling. Interpretation of the results should therefore be undertaken with care. Submission of contaminated samples has dropped from 10.6% of samples in 2016 to 9.6% in 2017. E.coli was the most frequently isolated organism accounting for 22.8% of isolates cultured (compared with 23.7% in 2016). E.coli is the most prevalent environmental cause of mastitis. Risk factors include poor hygiene, suboptimal milking machine function, teat end damage and lactation. Another frequently identified environmental organism, Streptococcus uberis was identified in 13.6% of submitted samples,a decline on previous years. Staphylococcus aureus, a “contagious” cause of mastitis, typically spread from cow to cow via the milking equipment was identified in 8.5% of samples submitted in 2017, compared to 8.1% in 2016.

Further analysis shows that of the 648 blood samples submitted by vets in practice, 324 (50%) were inadequate and of the 216 samples taken during a post mortem 141 (65%) were inadequate, this highlights the link between calf mortality and inadequate passive transfer of immunoglobulins.

As in 2016, parasitic disease and respiratory disease were the most commonly diagnosed causes of death in sheep of all ages in Northern Ireland. The relative importance of clostridial diseases increased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016.

It is caused by a virus known as Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus (JSRV) which spreads largely by the aerosol route but may also transmit from ewe to lamb via the colostrum and in utero. The disease is common in most sheep producing countries and GB, Northern Ireland and Ireland are no exception. Flocks affected with Jaagsiekte experience considerable loss through lowered production and increased ewe mortality and culling. Diagnosis in the live animal remains problematic though chest scanning for the detection of tumour tissue (Figure 10.2) becoming an increasingly used method. Figure 10.2: Lung section demonstrating ovine pulmonary adenomatosis (Jaagsiekte).

July and September saw a 60 % increase in the level of rainfall above normal, with June and August seeing 12% and 33% increase respectively. With these conditions, the ground remained damp throughout the summer, ideal for the survival of the intermediate host of the liver fuke, the snail Galba truncatula. Although in May and June the mean monthly temperatures were higher than the Northern Ireland average, the mean temperature for the period July to September, at 13.2˚C, was 0.5 ˚C lower than average. Mean temperatures of 10˚C or higher are necessary both for the breeding of the intermediate host, the snail Galba truncatula, and for the development of fluke to occur within the snail. A temperature of 10˚C is also the minimum at which fluke eggs will develop and hatch. The risk of liver fluke infection in autumn / winter 2017 was therefore assessed by AFBI as being particularly high especially in poorly drained areas.

(foetii from 264 abortions were examined in 2016). Significant pathogens were detected in 165 cases (67.6 %). Pathogens identified included Toxoplasma (74 cases, 30.3 %), Chlamydophilia abortus (44 cases, 18.0 %), E. coli (20 cases, 8.2 %), Campylobacter spp (12 cases 4.9%), Streptococcus spp (9 cases, 3.7 %), Leptospira (8 cases, 3.3 %), Trueperella pyogenes (5 cases, 2.0%) and Listeria (5 cases, 2.0 %). Toxoplasma continues to be the most commonly diagnosed pathogen despite vaccination being widely available. Susceptible sheep are infected following the ingestion of feed or water contaminated with oocysts which are highly resistant and can survive for long periods in moist conditions. Infection early in gestation can result in foetal death and resorption, whilst infection late in gestation can result in lambs being born normal and immune. However infection in mid gestation can result in still born lambs, weak lambs and mummified foetuses.
